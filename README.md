# battle-royale-fivem
I create a simple battle royale to use in my personal server.

To use the script type /evento to start and /pararevento to stop.

The script pulls all players to some random area in the lower part of the city. A giant red circle appears in which players cannot get out of it because it is like a layer of gas and will hurt the player to death.

When the white circle appears, run into it because the next safe will be there!
